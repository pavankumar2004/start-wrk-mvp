# Client Documentation - Phase 1

## Overview

The client-side application is built using React with TypeScript, focusing on user authentication and basic business profile management. This document outlines the key components and features implemented in Phase 1.

## Architecture

### Component Structure

## Key Components

### Authentication Components

#### LoginForm
- Handles user login
- Manages form state and validation
- Integrates with authentication API
- Stores JWT token in localStorage
